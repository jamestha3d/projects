# once channel selected displays messages sent to that channel. 100 at a time.
# messages sent to channel can be viewed by everyone viewing channel (emit). message sent with timestamp and display name. messages sent with sockets. so no reloading.
#remember channel user is on. (use localStorage). once user returns to site, it should reopen channel they left.

#add personal touch
